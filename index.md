The [Finite Element and Domain Decomposition Library (FEDDLib)](https://github.com/FEDDLib/FEDDLib) is an open-source, C++-based, object-oriented finite element library that is built on top of [Trilinos](https://trilinos.github.io/) and has access to domain decomposition solvers, particularly via [FROSch](https://cds.uni-koeln.de/en/tools/software/frosch), a subpackage of Trilinos. Trilinos is a software project for the solution of complex multiphysics problems in science and engineering. It has a multitude of (mostly) interoperable packages, for example, for parallel linear algebra operations, meshing, and the solution of linear and nonlinear problems. 

FEDDLib has been successfully applied to problems of fluid dynamics, solid mechanics, fluid-structure interaction, and fluid-structure-chemistry interaction; see the references at the bottom.

The FEDDLib code base is developed jointly by the group of [Prof. Dr. Axel Klawonn](https://numerik.uni-koeln.de/) (University of Cologne) with [Lea Sa√ümannshausen](https://numerik.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppe/l-sassmannshausen-m-sc), [Kyrill Ho](https://numerik.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppe/k-ho-m-sc), [Natalie Kubicki](https://numerik.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppe/n-kubicki-m-sc), and [Dr. Jascha Knepper](https://numerik.uni-koeln.de/arbeitsgruppe/dr-j-knepper), by [Dr. Alexander Heinlein](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/a.heinlein/) (TU Delft), and by the group of [Prof. Dr. Oliver Rheinbach](https://tu-freiberg.de/fakultaet1/institute/numerische-mathematik-und-optimierung/team) (TU Bergakademie Freiberg).
